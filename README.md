# CTU-IT251
Submission for a project from my first Java class. It's so terrible.
Why did I even post this, you ask? To show I have a sense of humor. There are so many things wrong with this code... I wouldn't even know where to begin. 

When I made this I had probably only programmed for somewhere between 20 and 30 hours, mostly just watching others and copying their code. This was the first thing I made where I had creative freedom over my code. 

It only had a handful of requirements. The biggest thing is it needed to display a slight understanding of a super class and extending a class. 

I will say, I was very proud of figuring out I could create an array object from the super-class, "Accounts a[]", and fill that array with objects from the sub-classes. It wasn't until the following week that we learned about polymorphism in the class.
